## Backstory
Dwaric has no recollection of his biological parents. He barely recalls living among a tribe of human barbarians. Eventually, he was traded to a traveling human priest for a barrel of mead. Early on he learned useful and rewarding skills including reading, writing, brewing, and caring for the down-trodden.

Years later, Dwaric found employment in a well-reputed band of mercenaries who were frequently called upon to clear nearby territories of Goblins, Orcs, and other marauders. The leadership, suspicious of Dwaric's youth and inexperience, assigned him to low risk support duties. Despite spending years on the back line, the motivated Dwarf became accustomed to battle. He trained with war equipment, and kept his friends alive. Most importantly, he finally found his calling - to serve Hanseath, The Bearded One, god of war, carousing, and alcohol.
